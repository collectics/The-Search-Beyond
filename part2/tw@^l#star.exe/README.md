Internal Description
--------------------
The program and the description alludes to the song "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."
Pianists will recognize the note names, going from top to bottom, with note names filled in in bold:

**c** c g g a a g / f f e **e d d** c

Use these four letters to fill in the four blanks, and you can now form the word "decent."

Twinkle Twinkle *is* a decent song, you know...
