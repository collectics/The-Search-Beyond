Internal Description
--------------------
Each line is a name of a planet in our solar system (plus Pluto, as Clyde Tombaugh found).
The vertical lines are tally marks, and there are no crosses this time.
Each blank space holds a letter. The zeroes are the letters we should be focusing on and collecting.
Collect all the letters, then unscramble them to spell the keyword.
