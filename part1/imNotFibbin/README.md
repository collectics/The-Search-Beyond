Internal Description
--------------------
Each line represents a tally mark.
Translated, the first four rows are:
2, 3, 5, 8
which are the first four numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (alluded to by the title of the puzzle).

There are four more rows, which are the next four numbers:
13, 21, 34, 55

Some of the tally marks, however, are already drawn, with the remainder for you to fill in.
Therefore:
- The fifth row is 10 + x; x = 3
- The sixth row is 20 + x; x = 1
- The seventh row is 30 + x; x = 4
- The eighth row is blank; x = 55
Since the Puzzlemaster is not fibbin', he's goin' uphill; so from the bottom-up.
